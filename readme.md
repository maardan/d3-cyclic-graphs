1) Install dependencies: $ npm install

2) Start server: $ npm start

3) Go to: http://localhost:9000/

For any improvements, I would:

-Implement touch and drag feature (especially for complex & rich data)
-Implement lines with arrows to appear when hovered over an edge
-Implement better logic to force render when the diffing algorithm is not kicking in
